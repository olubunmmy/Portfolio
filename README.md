# My Professional Portfolio
# Professional Statement
Aspiring Cybersecurity GRC Professional with a strong foundation in data analysis and a growing specialization in Governance, Risk, and Compliance. I recently earned the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am actively training as an ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) candidate.

My journey into cybersecurity is driven by a deep interest in aligning technical insights with organizational compliance and risk management. I’m building practical experience using industry-standard tools like ServiceNow, Qualys Policy Compliance, and other platforms that support effective security governance.

With hands-on experience in data analysis, I bring the ability to interpret complex datasets and transform them into meaningful insights that strengthen security strategies. I'm particularly focused on areas such as control implementation, compliance reporting, and continuous monitoring.

I'm eager to continue growing within the GRC domain—contributing to secure, resilient, and audit-ready environments.
