##  About Me

I’m **Adesanmi Bunmi**, an early-career cybersecurity professional with a deep curiosity for how technology works—and how it can be protected. In just six months, I’ve immersed myself in real-world labs, built a home cybersecurity lab from scratch, and earned globally recognized certifications to build a solid technical foundation.

My passion lies at the crossroads of **AI and Cybersecurity**, with a growing specialization in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. I believe cybersecurity isn’t just about defense—it’s about strategy, foresight, and responsible innovation.

To further strengthen my understanding of secure systems and automation, I am currently pursuing a **program in Software Development**. This complements my cybersecurity journey by enhancing my ability to build secure applications, analyze code-level vulnerabilities, and develop custom tools for risk management and threat mitigation.

##  What I’ve Done So Far

 **Earned industry-recognized certifications**:
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  
- ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)  
- IBM AI Fundamentals  

 **Built my own virtual lab**, configuring Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows VMs to simulate security environments and practice defensive techniques.

 **Completed hands-on labs and projects** in:
- Network security and traffic monitoring  
- Vulnerability scanning using **Qualys**  
- Security operations with tools like **ServiceNow**  
- Red and Blue teaming practice on **TryHackMe**

 **Engaged in simulations on The Forage**, solving challenges related to compliance, risk analysis, and security operations.

 **Actively developing technical skills** in:
- Python (for automation and basic scripting)  
- SQL (for data extraction, analysis, and security reporting)  
- SIEM awareness (Splunk basics)

##  What I Believe

> I believe security is not just a task it's a mindset.  
> It requires the ability to think critically, learn continuously, and act responsibly.

I approach every lab, simulation, or script not just to *complete* it, but to understand the **why** behind the **how**.

##  What’s Next

I’m focused on refining my skills in **Python and SQL**, advancing in **GRC frameworks**, and building secure applications through my **software development program**. My goal is to contribute to open-source security projects and join a collaborative SOC or GRC team where I can continue growing.
